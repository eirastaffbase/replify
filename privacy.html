    <h1>Privacy Policy for Replify Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 23, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Replify Chrome Extension</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>The Replify Chrome Extension itself does <strong>not</strong> directly collect or store any personal data from users on external servers. Any API keys or settings you enter within the extension are stored <strong>locally</strong> in your browser's local storage. This data is not transmitted to us or any third-party servers for persistent storage by the extension itself.</p>

    <h2>Interaction with External Services</h2>
    <p>The Replify Chrome Extension interacts with the following external services to provide its functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Staffbase APIs:</strong> The extension uses Staffbase APIs for authentication and to apply branding changes to Staffbase environments. When you use these features, your API key is transmitted directly to Staffbase for authentication. We do not store this API key beyond its use within your current browser session, or beyond the local storage of your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party Environment Setup Service:</strong> When you use the environment setup features, data such as your API token and configuration choices (e.g., enabled features, quick links) are transmitted to a third-party service hosted on Google Cloud (sb-news-generator.uc.r.appspot.com) to facilitate the creation of new Staffbase environments. Please review the privacy policy of this service for details on their data handling practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these external services to understand how your data is collected, used, and protected by them.</p>

    <h2>Usage Analytics</h2>
    <p>The Replify Chrome Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect any usage data or analytics about how you use the extension itself. We do not employ any tracking mechanisms within the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>API keys and settings you choose to save are stored locally in your browser's storage. You can clear this data at any time by managing your browser's local storage or by removing/resetting the extension.</p>
    <p>Data transmitted to external services is subject to their respective data retention policies.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Replify Chrome Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal data from children. Our interactions with external services are also not directed towards children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.</p>
